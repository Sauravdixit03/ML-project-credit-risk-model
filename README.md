# ML-project-credit-risk-model
Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a loan applicant will default or not using machine learning classification techniques.
It helps financial institutions minimize risk and make better lending decisions.

Objectives

1.Analyze customer and financial data.
2.Handle missing values, outliers, and imbalanced classes.
3.Build machine learning models for classification.
4.Compare model performance using multiple evaluation metrics.
5.Deploy the model for practical usage.

Skills & Tools Used

- Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Techniques: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Approach

1.Data Preprocessing:

- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Balanced dataset using oversampling/undersampling techniques.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Visualized distributions and correlations.
- Identified key features affecting loan default.

3.Model Building:

- Trained multiple classification models.
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance.

4.Model Evaluation:

- Compared models using classification metrics.
- Selected best-performing model.

Results

Best-performing model achieved 93% accuracy.
My precesion for default group is 56% and for non-default group is 99%.
Recall for default group is 94% and for non-default group is 93%. 
Provides a reliable way to assess applicant risk for credit approval.
